Hi ! My name is Drys,
Computer Science student with a passion for problem-solving and collaborative projects. I aim to develop tools that have real impact. Naturally interested in fields like health, space, or cybersecurity.

Enthusiastic learner with a drive for exploration and knowledge discovery. I start out self-taught as a hobby and realised coding is what I want to do for a living.
